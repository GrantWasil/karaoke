// Node graph data model + passthrough graph-builder for the Node-Based Web
// Audio Chain Builder.
//
// Loaded as a plain (non-module) <script> — same pattern as audio-engine.js:
// a single IIFE exposing one global namespace, `window.AudioGraph`.
//
// AE-2 scope (Milestone M1 — "prove the thin end-to-end path before adding
// complexity"):
//   - An ordered in-memory node MODEL (`{id, type, params}` entries),
//     intentionally decoupled from the real Web Audio node instances it
//     describes. The model is the thing later UI/undo/persistence code
//     reasons about; `buildGraph()` is the only piece that knows how to turn
//     it into real audio wiring.
//   - `buildGraph()`, the mechanical connector: mic source -> each modeled
//     node's real AudioNode, in order -> AudioContext.destination. With an
//     EMPTY model this reduces to a direct passthrough (source straight to
//     destination), which is exactly the M1 passthrough requirement.
//   - `registerNodeType()` / `nodeFactories`, the registry contract that
//     later tasks (AE-5 through AE-10: Gain, Compressor, EQ, Delay, Reverb,
//     Limiter) will populate. Nothing registers into it yet — that's fine,
//     `buildGraph([])` never consults it.
//
// AE-3 addendum: this file also CREATES and WIRES the shared "chain gate"
// `GainNode` (see getChainGate() below) — a single point after the last
// chain node where the whole chain can be silenced. Per ADR-0001, this
// file owns the gate's TOPOLOGY only: its gain automation belongs to
// src/output-gate.js, to which the node is handed over exactly once at
// creation (OutputGate.attach). Nothing in this file (or anywhere else)
// writes gate.gain directly — silence requests are OutputGate holds.
// buildGraph() also tracks `firstChainNode` — the specific node sourceNode
// is currently connected to — so it can disconnect exactly that one edge
// on rebuild instead of a blanket `sourceNode.disconnect()`, which would
// also sever AudioBypass's independent tap off of sourceNode. See the
// comments in buildGraph() and getChainGate() below.
//
// AE-4 scope (this task) — buildGraph() is now glitch-free and reuse-aware:
//   - Glitch-free live rewiring: a rebuild holds the OutputGate 'duck'
//     reason (near-silence), performs the graph surgery while ducked, then
//     releases it — no audible pop/click from tearing down and reconnecting
//     live nodes. The duck ramp length is OutputGate.DUCK_FADE_S.
//   - Node-instance reuse across rebuilds: an id present in both the old and
//     new model reuses the SAME AudioNode object (preserving internal DSP
//     state — e.g. a compressor's envelope, a delay's buffer contents —
//     across a pure reorder) instead of recreating it from scratch. Only ids
//     that are actually new call their registered factory.
//   - The rewire itself is deferred (via setTimeout, timed to land after the
//     duck-down fade completes) and debounced: rapid successive buildGraph()
//     calls cancel any not-yet-executed previous rewire, so only the LAST
//     call's model is actually built. Resolving the new model's node
//     instances (including throwing on an unknown type) still happens
//     synchronously, up front, before any ducking — see buildGraph() below
//     for why.
//   These were both explicitly out-of-scope markers left by AE-2/AE-3,
//   deferred to this task. See buildGraph() below for the full algorithm and
//   the specific bugs its design avoids.
//
// AE-7 addendum: extends the factory contract to allow a COMPOSITE return
// value. Before this task every registered factory (Gain, Compressor)
// returned a single plain AudioNode that served as both the connection
// point for whatever comes before it and for whatever comes after it — true
// for one node, but not for EQ (src/node-eq.js), the first type built from
// more than one internal AudioNode (three chained BiquadFilterNodes).
// buildGraph() now identifies each resolved node's real input/output via
// getNodeInput()/getNodeOutput() (defined just above buildGraph()) instead
// of assuming the resolved value itself is directly connectable in both
// directions. A factory may still return a plain AudioNode (Gain and
// Compressor need zero changes) or, for a composite type, a plain object
// shaped `{ input: AudioNode, output: AudioNode, ...anythingElse }` — the
// `...anythingElse` lets a type also expose its individual internal nodes
// for NodeTypes.applyParam() to reach (e.g. EQ's `.low`/`.mid`/`.high`).
// See the comments at getNodeInput()/getNodeOutput() and inside
// buildGraph()'s deferred rewire for exactly where this matters.
//
// MC-4 addendum — host-owned output attenuator (RQ-3,
// docs/ultron/research/rq3-loudness-policy.md): a SECOND persistent GainNode,
// `outputAttenuator`, permanently inserted between the shared chain gate and
// audioContext.destination (chainGate -> outputAttenuator -> destination).
// Its fixed gain implements rq3's default output ceiling of -6 dBFS (linear
// 10^(-6/20) = 0.5012): the limiter's spec-mandated makeup gain plus its
// 0-1.5 ms attack overshoot plus intersample peaks can sit up to +3-4 dB
// above the ceiling PARAM, so the host adds a margin no chain setting can
// reach. It is HOST-OWNED: created once with the graph, never torn down or
// rewired by buildGraph()'s teardown (the teardown section disconnects only
// nodes in `nodeInstances`; the gate and the attenuator are deliberately
// not in it), never exposed as a param to any agent tool (src/mcp-tools.js
// hard-rejects attempts to address it), and never touched by AudioBypass —
// the bypass dry tap connects sourceNode straight to destination
// independently, so Bypass remains a fully human-controlled pure path.

   *   previous call's not-yet-executed phase 2, so only the LAST call's
   *   model is actually built (the gate is already ducked or ducking from
   *   the earlier call, so re-ducking is harmless).
   *
   * Teardown-then-rebuild happens strictly sequentially, not overlapping —
   * deliberately simpler than connecting the new edges before disconnecting
   * the old ones at the edge level, which has a real collision bug: if the
   * old and new topologies share an edge (e.g. rearranging an already-empty
   * chain, where both old and new first-hop target is the gate itself),
   * connecting "new" while "old" is still connected either no-ops
   * confusingly or the subsequent disconnect of "old" removes the shared
   * edge just added. Since phase 2 runs entirely while the gate is already
   * ducked to near-silence, there's no audible benefit to overlapping old/
   * new — sequential teardown-then-rebuild is exactly as inaudible and
   * avoids that bug entirely.
   *
   * The duck is an OutputGate hold (ADR-0001): releasing 'duck' at the end
   * ramps back up ONLY when no other hold is active. A rebuild while
   * Bypass is engaged or the watchdog is latched therefore can never
   * schedule an upward ramp — the precedence rule lives inside OutputGate,
   * not here, and this function no longer consults either module.
   *
   * This deliberately does NOT touch any other connection sourceNode may
   * have — notably AudioBypass's independent dry tap (src/audio-bypass.js)
   * — so that tap survives every rebuild. See the firstChainNode comment
   * near the top of this file.
   *
   * With an empty `model`, the result is a direct passthrough: mic source
   * connected straight to the chain gate, then to destination, zero
   * processing nodes in between.
