// Bypass routing for the Node-Based Web Audio Chain Builder.
//
// Loaded as a plain (non-module) <script> — same pattern as audio-engine.js
// and audio-graph.js: a single IIFE exposing one global namespace,
// `window.AudioBypass`.
//
// AE-3 scope: an independent "dry" mic-to-output path, completely decoupled
// from the health of the effect chain built by AudioGraph.buildGraph(). Per
// the project brief (town-hall.md), this is the app's single most important
// reliability feature — at a real karaoke event there is no physical audio
// fallback, so Bypass is the only way to restore clean audio to the room if
// the effect chain breaks mid-song.
//
// Architecture (independence from the chain, and why it holds):
//   - `bypassGain` is a dedicated GainNode fed directly from
//     AudioEngine.sourceNode and connected straight to
//     AudioEngine.audioContext.destination (see reconnectSource()). This tap
//     is a completely separate outgoing edge off of sourceNode from the one
//     AudioGraph.buildGraph() manages.
//   - AudioGraph.buildGraph() was fixed (see src/audio-graph.js) to only
//     ever disconnect the ONE specific edge it owns
//     (sourceNode -> firstChainNode) instead of a blanket
//     sourceNode.disconnect() — so this tap survives every chain rebuild,
//     and also survives buildGraph() throwing partway through a rebuild
//     (leaving the chain itself in a broken/torn-down state).
//   - Engaging bypass holds OutputGate's 'bypass' reason (ADR-0001),
//     silencing whatever the chain is doing however broken it currently
//     is, while ramping bypassGain up to 1 in the same breath — so the
//     room hears a clean mic signal near-instantly, regardless of chain
//     health. This module never touches the chain gate node itself.
//   - Precedence with the watchdog latch (the old issue #3 concern) now
//     lives INSIDE OutputGate: disengaging bypass releases the 'bypass'
//     hold, and OutputGate ramps the chain back up only if no other hold
//     (e.g. a watchdog latch) remains — this file no longer consults
//     MeterTaps at all. The dry path itself is never touched by the
//     watchdog, so engaging bypass while latched still hands the room
//     the clean mic signal: bypass remains the operator's escape exactly
//     as designed.

  // Short click-avoiding ramp duration. Deliberately shorter than a normal
  // chain-edit fade (see AE-4's RQ-1 research) would use — this is an

  // is still enough to avoid an audible click/pop from a hard gain jump.
